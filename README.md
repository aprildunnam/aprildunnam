Hey there, I'm April!  I started out in the .NET and SharePoint Development space but ended up finding a love for low code. I'm a woman who codes, but am passionate about teaching others how to build apps and automation with no code/low code. I'm extremely fortunate to have a job where I can make this happen every day as a Power Platform Advocate at Microsoft. 

Before joining Microsoft, I ran my own consulting company and was a Microsoft MVP. During my time in consulting and in the MVP program I found my love for creating technical videos on YouTube. I'm a maker at heart and love tinkering and coming up with new apps and automations. I'm a huge music fan and obsessed with karaoke 🎙️.
